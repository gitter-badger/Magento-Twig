This is the integration of Twig for Magento.

Tested under Magento 1.4.1.1


== INSTALLATION ==
- Download Twig @http://github.com/fabpot/twig
- Copy the lib/Twig directory to your magento lib/ directory
- Copy this extension to your Magento directory

== USAGE ==

When writing a block for Magento, just extend your block from Mashpress_Twig_Block_Template.

I.E.:

class MyCompany_MyModule_Block_MyBlock extends Mashpress_Twig_Block_Template
{
}

If you want to give access to a function written in your block to your template, just add a "TwigExtention" suffix to your function:

class MyCompany_MyModule_Block_MyBlock extends Mashpress_Twig_Block_Template
{
	public function myFunctionTwigExtention()
	{
		return "Hello";
	}
}

However, in your template, you have to use the name of the function without the "TwigExtension" suffix:

{{ myFunction() }}
